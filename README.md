SimSoliqTools
=============

## bundling tools for (AI)MD simulations of solid/liquid interfaces

This project is a collective of tools for the analysis and post processing of 
(molecular dynamics) simulations of solid/liquid interfaces

``SimSoligTools`` is organized as a python (2.7/3.4) module incl. executive 
scripts

- i/o routines for data collection of MD output (VASP)
- i/o routines for preparation of singlepoint calculations on MD trajectories
- routines for analysis of energetics in MD trajectories
- routines for analysis of the water structure in MD trajectories
- routines to track adsorbates on surface during the AIMD simulations

### Installation

```bash
git clone ...
